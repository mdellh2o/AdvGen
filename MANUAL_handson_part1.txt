# Set up the virtual machine
1 download Virtual Box from Oracle https://www.virtualbox.org/
2 Execute the Virtual Box installler and if a window pops up asking for the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package, continue with step 2a, otherwise follow the installation process and skip 2a.
2a Open the link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version, scroll down to "Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Version" and download the right .exe file for your laptop (for windows probably https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and execute the installer, then retry the Virtual Box installation.
3 download the virtual machine
4 open Virtual Box and click on the green plus ("Add")
5 Navigate to the downloaded virtual machine
6 in Virtual Box click on Start and wait for Ubuntu to boot
7 login (username: genomics. password: 1234)
